### mmonkeys

A million monkeys typing the works of Shakespeare.

### overview

A Kotlin project to simulate the random typing of one
million monkeys, to match the complete works of
Shakespeare, with intermediate output and progress.

### criteria

There is much debate about what it means to create the
works. I've read one where the criterion was for each
seven-character sequence to be sought in any
seven-character sequence within the canon, and if it matches,
then the sequence is matched.

Interesting, and a fascinating map-reduce scenario,
but that's not what I think people mean.

In this project, the idea is that a monkey types a
complete sentence -- random characters until hitting a
period. That sentence is then virtually printed off on
a scrap of paper and sent to a curator of Shakespearean
works, and if that scrap matches a full sentence
within the canon, then there is a match.

Yeah. That's going to take a while.

And if that sounds similar to the scenario in the
Professor and the Madman, that's intentional. 

So in the interim, this project will also match against
subsets of the canon -- individual works, and famous
lines.

### feedback

I'm writing this project to satisfy my own curiosities,
one being the feasibility of that often-repeated phrase,
and the other to learn Kotlin.

So if you're a Kotlin expert (compared to me, that's
someone with more than a few weeks of experience), then feel
free/encouraged to send feedback about how to improve
this. Obviously this project makes much usage of 
coroutines, so that should be focused on.

I appreciate your interest in this project, and I
hope you find it interesting.

### disclaimer

No monkeys were harmed in the production of this project.
